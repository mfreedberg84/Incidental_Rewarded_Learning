# Incidental_Rewarded_Learning

Reward has been shown to change behavior as a result of incentive learning (by motivating the individual
to increase their effort) and instrumental learning (by increasing the frequency of a particular behavior).
However, Palminteri et al. (2011) demonstrated that reward can also improve the incidental learning of
a motor skill even when participants are unaware of the relationship between the reward and the motor
act. Nonetheless, it remains unknown whether these effects of reward are the indirect results of
manipulations of top– down factors. To identify the locus of the benefit associated with rewarded
incidental learning, we used a chord-learning task (Seibel, 1963) in which the correct performance of
some chords was consistently rewarded with points necessary to complete the block whereas the correct
performance of other chords was not rewarded. Following training, participants performed a transfer
phase without reward and then answered a questionnaire to assess explicit awareness about the rewards.
Experiment 1 revealed that rewarded chords were performed more quickly than unrewarded chords, and
there was little awareness about the relationship between chords and reward. Experiment 2 obtained
similar findings with simplified responses to show that the advantage for rewarded stimulus combinations
reflected more efficient binding of stimulus–response (S-R) associations, rather than a response bias for
rewarded associations or improved motor learning. These results indicate that rewards can be used to
significantly improve the learning of S-R associations without directly manipulating top– down factors.
